/**
 * WORLDS — evaluation, folds, and read routing. A WORLD is one
 * self-consistent assignment of values to every atom, produced by replaying
 * exactly the log entries that world may see, in timeline order (the full
 * vocabulary — write log, batch, render pass, arena — is defined at the top
 * of concurrent.ts). This module owns:
 *
 *  - the `World` type and `visibleAt`, THE two-clause visibility rule;
 *  - `foldAtom` / `applyOp` / `eqAtom` — the fold family (one op-application
 *    rule, one equality rule) and the fold-purity bracket (`inCallback`);
 *  - `evaluate` — world evaluation (arena-served render/committed worlds,
 *    kernel-served newest, memo-free fold-throughs for mountFix worlds) with
 *    per-world cycle detection;
 *  - read routing: the resolution order (fold-purity throw → evaluation
 *    world on stack → open capture frame → the driver's ambient provider),
 *    the routed read bodies (`routedAtomRead` / `routedComputedRead` — the
 *    public `.state` getters call them directly when `routingActive` is
 *    set), and the one-flag arming (`syncReadRouting` maintains graph.ts's
 *    `routingActive` boolean at every world/capture/provider transition —
 *    the merged replacement for the old nullable host hooks).
 *
 * THE SHARED ENGINE CORE RECORD (`EngineCore`) is declared here: the one
 * deps/table record the strongly-connected mechanisms — World, WorldArena,
 * settlement (and the Subscription boundary revalidation) — are wired
 * through. `createEngineCore` builds it at the composition site with the
 * resident-state edges filled and every factory slot stubbed; each factory
 * then assigns its operation table onto the record, and every cross-module
 * call reads its slot AT CALL TIME (late binding — never an import-time
 * reference), which is what closes the evaluate → arenaServe → foldAtom and
 * settlement → arenas → worlds → corrections cycles. Shared mutable scalars
 * (the evaluation-frame state, the routing state, the operation depth) live
 * as FIELDS on the record: hot functions load the record once into a local
 * and keep the one-property-load access shape the class fields had.
