// The stress-test computation field, ported from the dalien-signals
// example. DOM-free: everything here speaks the id-based runtime bridge
// (see runtime.ts), so any benchmark-adapter library can drive it.
//
// Cells are integer ids; parameters live in shared typed arrays so each
// cell's closure captures a single offset.
//
// The field is built in BANDS of 64 rows that alternate between two
// shapes, chosen to stress opposite ends of a reactivity system:
//
// - DEEP bands (even indexes, flowing downward). Every cell reads exactly
//   one parent in the previous row, shifted by a per-row shear so the
//   columns bend. The shear is a whole-row rotation, so the parent map is
//   a bijection: one source write propagates through exactly one cell per
//   row, 64 levels deep — long serial re-validation chains in thin
//   columns.
// - WIDE bands (odd indexes, flowing upward). The source row keeps one
//   signal per pixel, but every ~32nd one is a HUB, and every other cell
//   in the band reads its two nearest hubs (blended by column position,
//   faded by distance from the source row). Each hub therefore carries
//   thousands of subscribers, and one hub write triggers a broad, shallow
//   invalidation wave — one-to-many fan-out.
//
// Adjacent bands flow toward opposite seams: a deep band's faded tail
// meets a wide band's faded tail, and a wide band's source row meets the
// next deep band's source row, so seams join rows of matching energy.
//
// `quantize` rounds outputs to a coarse step (the equality cutoff prunes
// fading cascades); `epoch` is read by every cell, so bumping it
// invalidates the whole graph in one write.
