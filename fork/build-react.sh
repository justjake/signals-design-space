# Build the patched React (vendor/react) packages our workspace consumes.
# (Ported from react-signals-fable scripts/build-react.sh; see fork/README.md.)
#
# Uses scripts/rollup/build.js directly (~13s for our bundle set) rather than
# `yarn build` (build-all-release-channels.js), which builds every channel for
# minutes and overwrites packages/shared/ReactVersion.js with a placeholder.
#
# Artifacts land in vendor/react/build/oss-experimental/{react,react-dom,scheduler}.
# The workspace consumes them via `link:` overrides in the root package.json, so
# a rebuild is picked up without re-running pnpm install.
#
# The built react-dom resolves `scheduler`/`react` by walking up its real path
# into vendor/react/node_modules, where yarn links point at *source* packages;
# the node_modules dir of symlinks created below fixes resolution.
